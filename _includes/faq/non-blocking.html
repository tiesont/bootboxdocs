        </p>
        <p>
            Bootbox is primarily an engine for generating markup on which Bootstrap's <samp>modal()</samp> function can be called. HTML elements
            don't (at the moment) have the functionality needed to be thread-blockers. <b>Remember:</b> Bootstrap modals are really just positioned
            <samp>&lt;div&gt;</samp> elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is an experimental element, <samp>&lt;dialog&gt;</samp> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog" target="_blank">(MDN)</a>,
            which (in theory) <em>will</em> be able to thread-block; it's basically a standardized version of an interactive element which can be styled.
            Browser support isn't really where it needs to be in order to make the switch, so for now, remember to use callbacks with your modals.
